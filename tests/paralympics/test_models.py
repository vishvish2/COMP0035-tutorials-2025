""" Tests for paralympic app in src/para_app

The SQLModel documentation for testing focuses on FastAPI apps which you do not have:
https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/tutorial/fastapi/tests/#pytest-fixtures

The following tutorial covers testing using only SQLModel:
 https://pytest-with-eric.com/database-testing/pytest-sql-database-testing/

Tests included:

    - Games instance with an invalid year
    - Games instance with a valid year
    - Calculate duration where the start_date and end_date are both present
    - Calculate duration where the start_date and end_date are not present
    - Calculate the mf ratio where the participants_m and participants_f are present
    - Calculate the mf ratio where the participants_m and participants_f are not present
